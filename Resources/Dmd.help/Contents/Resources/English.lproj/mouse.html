  <h1>About the Mosue</h1>

  <p>You may notice that the cursor on the emulated DMD 5620
    sometimes does not match up perfectly with the
    Macintosh pointer. This is a known problem.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there is no way to fix this. The
    terminal's ROM program always interprets mouse
    position in a relative way, not as fixed points,
    so the cursors can come out of alignment.</p>

  <p>To work around this problem, &ldquo;chase&rdquo;
    the DMD 5620 cursor to the top of the screen with
    the Macintosh pointer until the two are aligned again.
    Then, they should stay in alignment.</p>
