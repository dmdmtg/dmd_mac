  <h1>Terminal Setup</h1>

  <p>The DMD 5620 terminal has a battery-backed memory area used to
    store terminal settings. To configure the terminal settings, use
    the <strong>SETUP</strong> key (this is mapped
    to <strong>F9</strong> on the Macintosh keyboard).</p>

  <p>Pressing <strong>SETUP</strong> (<strong>F9</strong>) will bring up
    the terminal's built-in setup program. A new menu will appear along
    the bottom of the terminal display area.</p>

  <p>The menu items may be selected either with the mouse by clicking
    the left mouse button, or with a corresponding function key. From
    left to right, these items correspond to <strong>F1</strong>
    through <strong>F8</strong>.</p>

  <p>After making any changes, press the <strong>F9</strong> key on
    the keyboard again (or click the right mouse button) to store the
    settings.  These settings will be remembered between runs of the
    emulator.</p>

  <h2>Port Options</h2>

  <img src="../shrd/setup_port_options.png" alt="Setup Port Options" text="Setup Port Options" />

  <p>The <strong>Port Options</strong> menu allows you to change settings for
    the emulated serial port. Clicking on <strong>Port A Options</strong> or
    pressing the <strong>F2</strong> key will reveal the following menu.</p>

  <img src="../shrd/setup_port_a_options.png" alt="Setup Port A Options" text="Setup Port A Options" />

  <p>The <strong>Parity</strong>, <strong>Bits/Char</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>,
    and <strong>Rcv  Flow</strong> menus  have no effect on a Telnet
    connection and can safely be ignored. The <strong>Speed</strong> menu,
    however, is faithfully emulated and characters will be sent and received
    at the selected rate.</p>

  <p>Repeatedly clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> button or pressing
    the <strong>F2</strong> key will cycle through the available speeds. You can
    select from:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>300 baud</li>
    <li>1200 baud</li>
    <li>2400 baud</li>
    <li>4800 baud</li>
    <li>9600 baud</li>
    <li>19200 baud</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>(Note: At the moment, only Port A, the main port used to
    communicate with a remote host, is emulated. Changing settings for
      Port B will have no effect.)</em></p>

  <p>Clicking on <strong>Main Menu</strong> or pressing
    the <strong>F1</strong> key will return you to the main settings
    menu.</p>

  <img src="../shrd/setup_host_options.png" alt="Setup Host Options" text="Setup Host Options" />

  <p>The <strong>Host Options</strong> menu controls various features of
    communication between the terminal and the host. These settings are
    described below.</p>

  <h3>Duplex</h3>

  <p><em>Full</em>, the default, means that the terminal will not echo
    transmitted characters back to the screen. This is normally the
    required setting for a UNIX host. <em>Half</em> means that
    transmitted characters will be echoed back to the screen.</p>

  <p>The default is <em>Full</em>.</p>

  <h3>Encoding</h3>

  <p>This option selects whether the terminal will encode non-printable
    ASCII characters when sent to the host. It's safe to leave this on
    the default setting, <em>Off</em>.</p>

  <h3>Gen Flow</h3>

  <p>This option selects whether the terminal will generate ASCII
    DC1/DC3 characters to the host. It's safe to leave this on the
    default setting, <em>On</em>.</p>

  <h3>Pass Flow</h3>

  <p>This option selects whether DC1/DC3 characters typed at the
    keyboard will be passed to the host. It's safe to leave this on
    the default setting,
    <em>No</em>.</p>

  <p>There are two pages of <strong>Preferences</strong> settings.</p>

    to <em>Blink</em>, the cursor will blink once every second. The
    default is <em>No Blink</em>.</p>

  <h3>Repeat</h3>

  <p><em>(Note: This feature is not emulated. The terminal will
      always use the macOS key repeat speed instead.)</em></p>

  <p>If set to <em>Right</em>, the mouse buttons are numbered 1, 2,
    and 3 from left to right. If set to <em>Left</em>, the mouse
    buttons are numbered 3, 2, and 1 from left to right. The default
    is <em>Right</em>.</p>

    new line (ASCII 0x0a). Selecting <em>NL</em> causes
    an advance to the beginning of hte next line. Selecting
    <em>Index</em> causes an advance to the same position on
    the next line. The default is <em>Index</em>.</p>

  <h3>Return</h3>

  <p>This option selects the sequence sent by
    the <strong>Return</strong> key on the
    keyboard. Selecting <em>CR</em> sends a carriage return (ASCII
    0x0d). Selecting <em>CR/LF</em> sends a carriage return followed
    by a line feed (ASCII 0x0a).  Selecting <em>LF</em> sends a line
    feed only. The default is <em>CR</em></p>
